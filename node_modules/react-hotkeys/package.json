The documentation for the latest stable release is available [here](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/tree/v1.1.4). ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨\n\n### Upgrading from 1.\\*.\\* ?\n\nSee the [upgrade notes](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/releases/tag/v2.0.0-pre1).\n\n## Feature Overview\n\n- Offers a minimal declarative [JSX](#HotKeys-component-API) and [HoC](#withHotKeys-HoC-API) APIs\n- Supports [browser key names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) and [Mousetrap syntax](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)\n- Allows you to define [global](#GlobalHotKeys-component) and [in-focus](#HotKeys-component) hot keys\n- Allows you to easily [display a list of available hot keys to the user](#Displaying-a-list-of-available-hot-keys)\n- Works with React's Synthetic KeyboardEvents and event delegation and provides [predictable and expected behaviour](#Interaction-with-React) to anyone familiar with React\n- It is optimized by default, but allows you to turn off different optimisation measures in a granular fashion\n- It's customizable through a simple [configuration API](#Configuration)\n- [Optimized for larger applications](#Optimizations), with many hot keys active at once\n- Depends only on `prop-types` and a peer dependency of `react`\n- Uses rollup, Uglify and strips out comments and logging for a small production build\n- Has more than [1800 automated tests](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/tree/master/test)\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n#### Define a key map\n\n```javascript\nimport { HotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\nimport MyNode from \"./MyNode\";\n\nconst keyMap = {\n  SNAP_LEFT: \"command+left\",\n  DELETE_NODE: [\"del\", \"backspace\"]\n};\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <HotKeys keyMap={keyMap}>\n      <div>\n        <MyNode />\n        <MyNode />\n      </div>\n    </HotKeys>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n#### Define handlers\n\n```javascript\nimport { HotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nconst MyNode = () => {\n  const handlers = {\n    DELETE_NODE: this.deleteNode\n  };\n\n  return <HotKeys handlers={handlers}>Node contents</HotKeys>;\n};\n\nexport default MyNode;\n```\n\n## Install\n\n### CommonJS & ES6 Modules\n\n`react-hotkeys` is available as a CommonJS or a ES6 Modules through npm or yarn. It uses `NODE_ENV` to determine whether to export the development or production build in your library or application.\n\nIt is expected you will use a bundling tool like Webpack or Uglify to remove the version of the bundle you are not using with each version of your application's code, to keep the library size to a minimum.\n\n#### The latest pre-release\n\n##### npm\n\n```\nnpm install react-hotkeys@next --save\n```\n\n##### yarn\n\n```\nyarn add react-hotkeys@next\n```\n\n#### Latest stable release\n\n##### npm\n\n```\nnpm install react-hotkeys --save\n```\n\n##### yarn\n\n```\nyarn add react-hotkeys\n```\n\n### UMD\n\n`react-hotkeys` as a UMD module is available on your CDN of choice.\n\nChange `1.0.1` for the version that you would like to use.\n\n#### Development build\n\n```\n<script crossorigin src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-hotkeys@1.0.1/umd/react-hotkeys.js\"></script>\n```\n\n```\n<script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-hotkeys@1.0.1/umd/react-hotkeys.js\"></script>\n```\n\n#### Minified production build\n\n```\n<script crossorigin src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-hotkeys@1.0.1/umd/react-hotkeys.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n```\n<script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-hotkeys@1.0.1/umd/react-hotkeys.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Bower\n\nBower support was removed in `v1.0.0`, but those who already rely on earlier versions of `react-hotkeys` through Bower can continue to do so using the following command:\n\n```\nbower install react-hotkeys@0.10.0\n```\n\nThe Bower version of the package will **not** be supported going forward (including fixing any outstanding issues).\n\n## Defining key maps\n\n`react-hotkeys` uses key maps to decouple defining keyboard shortcuts from the functions they call. This allows hot keys and handler functions to be defined and maintained independent of one another.\n\n> When a user presses the corresponding combination or sequence of keys, it is said they _match_ the hot keys, which causes an action to be _triggered_. `react-hotkeys` may then resolve an appropriate handler function to _handle_ the action.\n\nKey maps are Plain Old JavaScript Objects, where the keys are the action names and the values are usually a [Mousetrap-supported](https://craig.is/killing/mice) or [Browser Key Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) sequence string (but can also be an [array](#Alternative-Hotkeys) or an [object](#Key-Combination-vs-Sequences)) that must be matched in order to trigger the action.\n\n```javascript\nconst keyMap = {\n  deleteNode: \"del\",\n  moveUp: \"up\"\n};\n```\n\n#### Key Combinations vs Sequences\n\nEvery hotkey or sequence string is parsed and treated as a sequence of key combinations. The simplest case is a sequence of 1 key combination, consisting of 1 key: e.g. `'a'` or `'shift'`.\n\n```\n// Key sequence with a combination of a single key\n'4'\n\n// Special single key sequence (ie. shift is handled automagically)\n'?'\n\n// Sequence of a single combination with multiple keys (keys must be pressed at the same time)\n'command+shift+k'\n\n// Sequence of multiple combinations (keys must be pressed and released one after another)\n'up down left right'\n```\n\n#### Full Reference\n\nPlease refer to [Mousetrap's documentation](https://craig.is/killing/mice) or [Browser Key Values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) for an exhaustive list of supported shortcuts and sequences.\n\n#### Alternative Hotkeys\n\nYou can specify multiple _alternative_ key sequences (they will trigger the same action) using arrays:\n\n```javascript\nconst keyMap = {\n  DELETE_NODE: [\"del\", \"backspace\"],\n  MOVE_UP: [\"up\", \"w\"]\n};\n```\n\n#### Specifying key events (keydown, keypress, keyup)\n\nBy default, `react-hotkeys` will match hotkey sequences on the `keydown` event (or, more precisely: on the `keydown` event of the last key to complete the last combination in a sequence).\n\nIf you want to trigger a single action on a different key event, you can use the object syntax and the `action` attribute to explicitly set which key event you wish to bind to:\n\n```javascript\nconst keyMap = {\n  CONTRACT: \"alt+down\",\n  COMMAND_DOWN: { sequence: \"command\", action: \"keydown\" }\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to change the default key event for all hotkeys, you can use the `defaultKeyEvent` option of the [configuration API](#Configuration).\n\nThe full list of valid key events is: `keypress`, `keydown`, and `keyup`.\n\n#### Deciding which key map syntax to use\n\nAs a general rule, you should use the syntax that is the most brief, but still allows you to express the configuration you want.\n\n| Question                                                                                  | Yes                                 | No                      |\n| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------- |\n| **Need to define alternative key sequences to trigger the same action?**                  | Use an array of strings or objects. | Use a string or object. |\n| **Need to explicitly define the key event to bind to (or some other additional option)?** | Use an object.                      | Use a string.           |\n\n## Defining Handlers\n\nKey maps trigger actions when they match a key sequence. Handlers are the functions that `react-hotkeys` calls to handle those actions.\n\nHandlers may be defined in the same `<HotKeys />` component as the key map:\n\n```javascript\nimport { HotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nconst keyMap = {\n  MOVE_UP: \"up\"\n};\n\nconst handlers = {\n  MOVE_UP: event => console.log(\"Move up hotkey called!\")\n};\n\n<HotKeys keyMap={keyMap} handlers={handlers}>\n  <input />\n</HotKeys>;\n```\n\nOr they may be defined in any _descendant_ of the `<HotKeys />` component that defines the key map:\n\n```javascript\nimport { HotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nconst keyMap = {\n  MOVE_UP: \"up\"\n};\n\nconst handlers = {\n  MOVE_UP: event => console.log(\"Move up hotkey called!\")\n};\n\n<HotKeys keyMap={keyMap}>\n  <div>\n    <HotKeys handlers={handlers}>\n      <input />\n    </HotKeys>\n  </div>\n\n  <div>\n    <input />\n  </div>\n</HotKeys>;\n```\n\n#### DEPRECATED: Hard Sequence Handlers\n\nHandlers associated to actions with names that are valid key sequence strings implicitly define actions that are matched by the corresponding key sequence. This means you do not have to define the key maps in order for these handlers to \"just work\".\n\nThis functionality is not advised and exists mainly for backwards compatibility. It is generally advisable to explicitly define an action in a key map rather than rely on this behaviour.\n\nTo use hard sequence handlers, you must first enable them using the `enableHardSequences` [configuration option](#Configuration).\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * If no named 'up' action has been defined in a key map and it is a valid\n * key sequence, react-hotkeys assumes it's a hard sequence handler and\n * implicitly defines an action for it\n */\n\nconst handlers = {\n  up: event => console.log(\"up key called\")\n};\n```\n\n## Interaction with React\n\nRather than re-invent the wheel, `react-hotkeys` piggy-backs of the React SyntheticEvent and event propagation, so all of the normal React behaviour that you expect still applies.\n\n- Key events propagate up from a source or target towards the root of the application.\n- If an event has `stopPropagation()` called on it, it will not be seen by components higher up in the render tree.\n\n## HotKeys components\n\n`<HotKeys>` components listen only to key events that happen when one of their DOM-mounted descendents are in focus (`<div/>`, `<span/>`, `<input/>`, etc). This emulates (and re-uses) the behaviour of the browser and React's SyntheticEvent propagation.\n\nThis is the default type of `<HotKeys />` component, and should normally be your first choice for efficiency and clarity (the user generally expects keyboard input to affect the focused element in the browser).\n\n### How action handlers are resolved\n\n> If one of the DOM-mounted descendents of an `<HotKeys>` component are in focus (and it is listening to key events) AND those key events match a hot key in the component's key map, then the corresponding action is triggered.\n\n`react-hotkeys` starts at the `<HotKeys />` component closest to the event's target (the element that was in focus when the key was pressed) and works its way up through the component tree of focused `<HotKeys />` components, looking for a matching handler for the action. The handler closest to the event target AND a descendant of the `<HotKeys />` component that defines the action (or the component itself), is the one that is called.\n\nThat is:\n\n- Unless one of the DOM-mounted descendents of a `<HotKeys>` component is in focus, the component's actions are not matched\n- Unless a `<HotKeys>` component is nested within the `<HotKeys />` component that defines the action (or is the same `<HotKeys />` component), its handler is not called\n- If a `<HotKeys />` component closer to the event target has defined a handler for the same action, a `<HotKeys />` component's handler won't be called (the closer component's handler will)\n\nA more exhaustive enumeration of `react-hotkeys` behaviour can be found by reviewing the [test suite](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/tree/master/test).\n\n### Managing focus in the browser\n\n#### Focusable elements\n\nHTML5 allows any element with a `tabindex` attribute to receive focus.\n\nIf you wish to support HTML4 you are limited to the following focusable elements:\n\n- `<a>`\n- `<area>`\n- `<button>`\n- `<input>`\n- `<object>`\n- `<select>`\n- `<textarea>`\n\n#### Tab Index\n\nIf no elements have a `tabindex` in a HTML document, the browser will tab between [focusable elements](#Focusable-elements) in the order that they appear in the DOM.\n\nIf there are elements with `tabindex` values greater than zero, they are iterated over first, according their `tabindex` value (from smallest to largest). Then the browser tabs over the focusable elements with a `0` or unspecified `tabindex` in the order that they appear in the DOM.\n\nIf any element is given a negative `tabindex`, it will be skipped when a user tabs through the document. However, a user may still click or touch on that element and it can be focused programmatically (see below).\n\n> By default, `<HotKeys>` render its children inside an element with a `tabindex` of `-1`. You can change this by passing a `tabIndex` prop to `<HotKeys>` or you can change the default `tabindex` value for all <HotKeys>`components using the`defaultTabIndex` option for the [Configuration API](#Configuration).\n\n#### Autofocus\n\nHTML5 supports a boolean `autofocus` attribute on the following input elements:\n\n- `<button>`\n- `<input>`\n- `<select>`\n- `<textarea>`\n\nIt can be used to automatically focus parts of your React application, without the need to [programmatically manage focus](#Programmatically-manage-focus).\n\nOnly one element in the document should have this attribute at any one time (the last element to mount with the attribute will take effect).\n\n#### Programmatically manage focus\n\nTo programmatically focus a DOM element, it must meet two requirements:\n\n- It must be a [focusable elements](#Focusable-element)\n- You must have a reference to it\n\nYou can get a reference to an element using React's `ref` property:\n\n```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    if (!prevProps.isFocused && this.props.isFocused) {\n      this._container.focus();\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <div ref={c => (this._container = c)}>My focusable content</div>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo get a reference to the DOM-mountable node used as a wrapper by `<HotKeys />`, use the `innerRef` prop:\n\n```javascript\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    componentDidMount() {\n        this._container.focus();\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <HotKeys innerRef={ (c) => this._container = c } >\n                My focusable content\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n#### Get the element currently in focus\n\nYou can retrieve the element that is currently focused using the following:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.activeElement;\n```\n\n## HotKeys component API\n\nThe HotKeys component provides a declarative and native JSX syntax that is best for succinctly declaring hotkeys in a way that best maintains separation and encapsulation with regards to the rest of your code base.\n\nHowever, it [does require that its children be wrapped in a DOM-mounted node](#Hotkeys-is-rendering-a-div-that-is-breaking-my-styling), which can break styling and add extra levels to your render tree.\n\n```javascript\n\n<HotKeys\n  /**\n   * An object that defines actions as keys and key sequences as values\n   * (using either a string, array or object).\n   *\n   * Actions defined in one HotKeys component are available to be handled\n   * in an descendent HotKeys component.\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  keyMap={ {} }\n\n  /**\n   * An object that defines handler functions as values, and the actions\n   * that they handle as keys.\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  handlers={ {} }\n\n  /**\n   * The type of DOM-mountable component that should be used to wrap\n   * the component's children.\n   */\n  component={ 'div' }\n\n  /**\n   * tabindex value to pass to DOM-mountable component wrapping children\n   */\n  tabIndex={-1}\n\n  /**\n   * Whether the keyMap or handlers are permitted to change after the\n   * component mounts. If false, changes to the keyMap and handlers\n   * props will be ignored\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  allowChanges={false}\n\n  /**\n   * A ref to add to the underlying DOM-mountable node.

What is returned is a new component that will accept all of the same props as a `<HotKey>` component, so you can specify key maps and handlers at render time, for example.\n\n> The component you wrap **must** take responsibility for passing the `hotKeys` props to a DOM-mountable element. If you fail to do this, key events will not be detected when a descendant of the component is in focus.\n\n```javascript\nimport { withHotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const { hotKeys, ...remainingProps } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div {...{ ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps }}>\n        <span>My HotKeys are effective here</span>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeys(MyComponent);\n\nconst keyMap = {\n  TEST: \"t\"\n};\n\nconst handlers = {\n  TEST: () => console.log(\"Test\")\n};\n\n<MyHotKeysComponent keyMap={keyMap} handlers={handlers}>\n  <div>You can press 't' to log to the console.</div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>;\n```\n\n### Pre-defining default prop values\n\nYou can use the second argument of `withHotKeys` to specify default values for any props you would normally pass to `<HotKeys />`. This means you do not have to specify them at render-time.\n\n> If you do provide prop values when you render the component, these will be merged with (and override) those defined in the second argument of `withHotKeys`.\n\n```javascript\nimport { withHotKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const { hotKeys, ...remainingProps } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div {...{ ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps }}>\n        <span>My HotKeys are effective here</span>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst keyMap = {\n  TEST: \"t\"\n};\n\nconst handlers = {\n  TEST: () => console.log(\"Test\")\n};\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeys(MyComponent, { keyMap, handlers });\n\n/**\n * Render without having to specify prop values\n */\n<MyHotKeysComponent>\n  <div>You can press 't' to log to the console.</div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>;\n```\n\n## GlobalHotKeys component\n\n`<GlobalHotKeys>` components match key events that occur anywhere in the document (even when no part of your React application is in focus).\n\n```javascript\nconst keyMap = { SHOW_ALL_HOTKEYS: \"shift+?\" };\nconst handlers = { SHOW_ALL_HOTKEYS: this.showHotKeysDialog };\n\n<GlobalHotKeys keyMap={keyMap} handlers={handlers} />;\n```\n\n`<GlobalHotKeys>` generally have no need for children, so should use a self-closing tag (as shown above). The only exception is when you are nesting other `<GlobalHotKeys>` components somewhere in the descendents (these are mounted before their parents, and so are generally matched first).\n\n### How actions and handlers are resolved\n\nRegardless of where `<GlobalHotKeys>` components appear in the render tree, they are matched with key events after the event has finished propagating through the React app (if the event originated in the React at all). This means if your React app is in focus and it handles a key event, it will be ignored by the `<GlobalHotKeys>` components.\n\nThe order used for resolving actions and handlers amongst `<GlobalHotKeys>` components, is the order in which they mounted (those mounted first, are given the chance to handle an action first). When a `<GlobalHotKeys>` component is unmounted, it is removed from consideration. This can get less deterministic over the course of a long session using a React app as components mount and unmount, so it is best to define actions and handlers that are globally unique.\n\nIt is recommended to use `<HotKeys>` components whenever possible for better performance and reliability.\n\n> You can use the [autofocus attributes](#Autofocus) or [programmatically manage focus](#Programmatically-manage-focus) to automatically focus your React app so the user doesn't have to select it in order for hot keys to take effect. It is common practice to place a `<HotKeys>` component towards the top of your application to match hot keys across your entire React application.\n\n## GlobalHotKeys component API\n\nThe GlobalHotKeys component provides a declarative and native JSX syntax for defining hotkeys that are applicable beyond you React application.\n\n```javascript\n<GlobalHotKeys\n  /**\n   * An object that defines actions as keys and key sequences as values\n   * (using either a string, array or object).\n   *\n   * Actions defined in one HotKeys component are available to be handled\n   * in an descendent HotKeys component.\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  keyMap={{}}\n  /**\n   * An object that defines handler functions as values, and the actions\n   * that they handle as keys.\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  handlers={{}}\n  /**\n   * Whether the keyMap or handlers are permitted to change after the\n   * component mounts. If false, changes to the keyMap and handlers\n   * props will be ignored\n   *\n   * Optional.\n   */\n  allowChanges={false}\n>\n  /** * Wraps all children in a DOM-mountable component */\n  {children}\n</GlobalHotKeys>\n```\n\n## Displaying a list of available hot keys\n\n`react-hotkeys` provides the `getApplicationKeyMap()` function for getting a mapping of all actions and key sequences that have been defined by components that are currently mounted.\n\nThey are returned as an object, with the action names as keys (it is up to you to decide how to translate them to be displayed) and arrays of key sequences that trigger them, as keys.\n\nBelow is how the example application renders a dialog of all available hot keys:\n\n```javascript\nimport { getApplicationKeyMap } from 'react-hotkeys';\n\n// ...\n\nrenderDialog() {\n    if (this.state.showDialog) {\n      const keyMap = getApplicationKeyMap();\n\n      return (\n        <div style={styles.DIALOG}>\n          <h2>\n            Keyboard shortcuts\n          </h2>\n\n          <table>\n            <tbody>\n            { Object.keys(keyMap).map((actionName) => (\n              <tr key={actionName}>\n                <td style={styles.KEYMAP_TABLE_CELL}>\n                  { actionName.replace('_', ' ') }\n                </td>\n                <td style={styles.KEYMAP_TABLE_CELL}>\n                  { keyMap[actionName].map((keySequence) => <span key={keySequence}>{keySequence}</span>) }\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n            )) }\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Ignoring events\n\nBy default, all key events that originate from `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>`, or have a `isContentEditable` attribute of `true` are ignored by `react-hotkeys`.\n\nIf this is not what you want for your application, you can modify the list of tags using the `ignoreTags` [configuration option](#Configuration) or if you need additional control, you can specify a brand new function using the `ignoreEventsCondition` [configuration option](#Configuration).\n\nIf you want an exception to the global ignore policy for a particular part of your app, then you can use the ObserveKeys component.\n\n### What it actually means to ignore an event\n\nWhen a keyboard event occurs, two things happen:\n\n* It's added to the record of the keys currently pressed (the current combination) and those were recently pressed (the current key sequence)\n* It's compared against the list of hotkeys you have defined\n\nWhen you ignore an event, if it's a keydown event (a new key is being pressed), it is not added to the key history and no attempt is made to match it against your hotkeys. If it's a keypress or a keyup event and the key already exists in the history, the event is recorded (the key is being released) but no attempt is made to find a corresponding hotkey.\n\nThis effectively means, no new ignored keys are recorded and any keys that are already pressed are recorded as being released so they don't bleed into subsequent key combinations.\n\n### IgnoreKeys component\n\n> You only need this component if you want to add extra key events to ignore, that are not already matched by `ignoreEventsCondition()`.\n\nIf you want `react-hotkeys` to ignore key events coming from a particular area of your app when it is in focus, you can use the `<IgnoreKeys/>` component:\n\n```javascript\nimport { IgnoreKeys } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\n<IgnoreKeys>\n  /** * Children that, when in focus, should have its key events ignored by *\n  react hotkeys */\n</IgnoreKeys>;\n```\n\n### IgnoreKeys component API\n\nBy default, `<IgnoreKeys />` will ignore all key events, but you can customize this behaviour by providing a whitelist or blacklist of events to ignore:\n\n```javascript\n<IgnoreKeys\n    /**\n     * The whitelist of keys that keyevents should be ignored. i.e. if you place\n     * a key in this list, all events related to it will be ignored by react\n     * hotkeys.\n     *\n     * Accepts a string or an array of strings.\n     */\n      only: { [] }\n\n     /**\n      * The blacklist of keys that keyevents should be not ignored. i.e.\n      * if you place a key in this list, all events related to it will be\n      * still be observed by react hotkeys\n      */\n     except: { [] }\n    >\n\n    /**\n     * Children that, when in focus, should have its key events ignored by\n     * react hotkeys\n     */\n\n     { children }\n\n</IgnoreKeys>\n```\n\n### withHotKeysIgnore HoC API\n\nSimilar to the `<HotKeys>`'s `withHotKeys()` function, there is a `withIgnoreKeys()` function for achieving the `<IgnoreKeys>` functionality, without the need for rendering a surrounding DOM-mountable element.\n\n```javascript\nimport { withHotKeysIgnore } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const { hotKeys, ...remainingProps } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div {...{ ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps }}>\n        <span>HotKeys ignores key events from here</span>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeysIgnore(MyComponent);\n\n<MyHotKeysComponent except={\"Escape\"}>\n  <div>All key events except the 'Escape' key are ignored here</div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>;\n```\n\n`withIgnoreKeys()` also accepts a second argument that becomes the default props of the component it returns:\n\n```javascript\nimport { withHotKeysIgnore } from \"react-hotkeys\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const { hotKeys, ...remainingProps } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div {...{ ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps }}>\n        <span>HotKeys ignores key events from here</span>\n\n        {this.props.children}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeysIgnore(MyComponent, { except: \"Escape\" });\n\n<MyHotKeysComponent>\n  <div>All key events except the 'Escape' key are ignored here</div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>;\n```\n\n### ObserveKeys component\n\n> You only need this component if you want to add *exceptions* to the key events that are matched by `ignoreEventsCondition()` (i.e. you want to observe key events, even though they are globally ignored by default).\n\nIf you want `react-hotkeys` to always observe key events coming from a particular area of your app when it is in focus (despite the global `ignoreEventsCondition`), you can use the `<ObserveKeys/>` component:\n\n```javascript\nimport {ObserveKeys} from 'react-hotkeys';\n\n<ObserveKeys>\n    /**\n     * Children that, when in focus, should have its key events always\n     * observed by react hotkeys\n     */\n</ObserveKeys>\n```\n\n### ObserveKeys component API\n\nBy default, `<ObserveKeys />` will force all key events to be observed, but you can customize this behaviour by providing a whitelist or blacklist of events to ignore:\n\n```javascript\n<ObserveKeys\n    /**\n     * The whitelist of keys that keyevents should be forced to be observed.\n     * i.e. if you place a key in this list, all events related to it will be\n     * observed by react hotkeys - even if it's ignored by the\n     * ignoreEventsCondition.\n     *\n     * Accepts a string or an array of strings.\n     */\n      only: { [] }\n\n     /**\n      * The blacklist of keys that keyevents should be forced to be observed.\n      * i.e. if you place a key in this list, all events related to it will be\n      * still be ignored by react hotkeys if they match ignoreEventsCondition\n      */\n     except: { [] }\n    >\n\n    /**\n     * Children that, when in focus, should have its key events observed by\n     * react hotkeys - even if they match ignoreEventsCondition\n     */\n\n     { children }\n\n</ObserveKeys>\n```\n\n### withHotKeysIgnore HoC API\n\nSimilar to the `<HotKeys>`'s `withHotKeys()` function, there is a `withObserveKeys()` function for achieving the `<ObserveKeys>` functionality, without the need for rendering a surrounding DOM-mountable element.\n\n```javascript\nimport {withHotKeysAlwaysObserve} from 'react-hotkeys';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const {hotKeys, ...remainingProps} = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div { ... { ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps } } >\n        <span>HotKeys always observes key events from here</span>\n\n       { this.props.children }\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeysAlwaysObserve(MyComponent);\n\n<MyHotKeysComponent except={ 'Escape' }>\n  <div>\n    All key events except the 'Escape' key are observed here\n  </div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>\n```\n\n`withObserveKeys()` also accepts a second argument that becomes the default props of the component it returns:\n\n```javascript\nimport {withHotKeysAlwaysObserve} from 'react-hotkeys';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    /**\n     * Must unwrap hotKeys prop and pass its values to a DOM-mountable\n     * element (like the div below).\n     */\n    const {hotKeys, ...remainingProps} = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      <div { ... { ...hotKeys, ...remainingProps } } >\n        <span>HotKeys observes key events from here</span>\n\n       { this.props.children }\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst MyHotKeysComponent = withHotKeysAlwaysObserve(MyComponent, { except: 'Escape' });\n\n<MyHotKeysComponent>\n  <div>\n    All key events that match the ignoreEventsCondition are still observed here, except the 'Escape' key\n  </div>\n</MyHotKeysComponent>\n```\n\n## Allowing hotkeys and handlers props to change\n\nFor performance reasons, by default `react-hotkeys` takes the `keyMap` and `handlers` prop values when `<HotKeys>` components are focused and when `<GlobalHotKeys>` components are mounted. It ignores all subsequent updates\nto their values when these props change.\n\nIf you need the ability to change them while `<HotKeys>` are still in focus, or while `<GlobalHotKeys>` are still mounted, then you can passe the `allowChanges` prop, permitting this behaviour for the particular component.\n\nIf you need to do this for all your `<HotKeys>` and `<GlobalHotKeys>` components, you can use the `ignoreKeymapAndHandlerChangesByDefault` option for the [Configuration API](#Configuration). This should normally never be done, as it can have significant performance implications.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe default behaviour across all `<HotKeys>` components is configured using the `configure` method.\n\n> configure() should be called as your app is initialising and before the first time you mount a `<HotKeys>` component anywhere your app.\n\nThe following options are available (**default values are shown**):\n\n```javascript\nimport {configure} from 'react-hotkeys';\n\nconfigure({\n  /**\n   * The level of logging of its own behaviour React HotKeys should perform.\n   */\n  logLevel: 'warn',\n\n  /**\n   * Default key event key maps are bound to (keydown|keypress|keyup)\n   */\n  defaultKeyEvent: 'keydown',\n\n  /**\n   * The default component type to wrap HotKey components' children in, to provide\n   * the required focus and keyboard event listening for HotKeys to function\n   */\n  defaultComponent: 'div',\n\n  /**\n   * The default tabIndex value passed to the wrapping component used to contain\n   * HotKey components' children. -1 skips focusing the element when tabbing through\n   * the DOM, but allows focusing programmatically.\n   */\n  defaultTabIndex: '-1',\n\n  /**\n   * The HTML tags that React HotKeys should ignore key events from.

Use the [`component` prop](#HotKeys-component-API) to specify a `span` or some other alternative DOM-mountable component to wrap your component in, each time you render a component you don't want to wrap in a div element.\n1. Use the [`defaultComponent` configuration option](#Configuration) to specify a `span` or some other alternative DOM-mountable component to wrap _all_ `<HotKeys>` children in.\n1. Use the [withHotKeys HoC API](#withHotKeys-HoC-API) to avoid rendering a wrapping component at all.\n\n#### Other keyboard event listeners are no longer being triggered\n\nFor improved performance, by default `react-hotkeys` calls `stopPropagation()` on all events that it handles. You can change this using the `stopEventPropagationAfterHandling` and `stopEventPropagationAfterIgnoring` [configuration options](#Configuration).\n\n#### Actions aren't being triggered when using withHotKeys\n\nCheck that you are [correctly passing the hotKeys props to a DOM-mountable component](#Pre-defining-default-prop-values).\n\n#### Actions aren't being triggered for HotKeys\n\nMake sure you are focusing a descendant of the `<HotKeys>` component before you press the keys.\n\nCheck that the `<HotKeys>` component that defines the handler is also an ancestor of the focused component, and is above (or _is_) the component that defines the `handlers`.\n\nAlso make sure your React application is not calling `stopPropagation()` on the key events before they reach the `<HotKeys>` component that defines the `keyMap`.\n\nFinally, make sure your key event are not coming from one of the [tags ignored by react-hotkeys](#Ignoring-events).\n\n#### Blue border appears around children of HotKeys\n\n`react-hotkeys` adds a `<div />` around its children with a `tabindex=\"-1\"` to allow them to be programmatically focused. This can result in browsers rendering a blue outline around them to visually indicate that they are the elements in the document that is currently in focus.\n\nThis can be disabled using CSS similar to the following:\n\n```css\ndiv[tabindex=\"-1\"]:focus {\n  outline: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Logging\n\n`react-hotkeys` provides comprehensive logging of all of its internal behaviour and allows setting one of 6 log levels.\n\nThe default level is `warn`, which provides warnings and errors only, and is generally sufficient for most usage. However, if you are troubleshooting an issue or reporting a bug, you should increase the log level to `debug` or `verbose` to see what is going on, and be able to communicate it concisely.\n\nYou can set the logging level using the `logLevel` [configuration option](#Configuration).\n\nFor performance reasons, only some of the log levels are available in the production build. You will need to use the development build to get the full log output.\n\n| Log Level | Severity  | Description                             | Available in Dev | Available in Prod |\n| :-------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------- |\n| verbose   | (highest) | `debug` + internal data representations | Yes              | No                |\n| debug     |           | `info` + event propagation info         | Yes              | No                |\n| info      |           | `warn` + general info                   | Yes              | No                |\n| warn      | (default) | `error` + warnings                      | Yes              | Yes               |\n| error     |           | Errors only (ignore warnings)           | Yes              | Yes               |\n| none      | (lowest)  | Log nothing                             | Yes              | Yes               |\n\nLogs appear in the developer console of the browser.\n\nEach line is prefixed with (where applicable):\n\n- The focus tree id\n- The component id\n- The event id\n\nEach id is also given a coloured emoticon, to make it easy to visually trace the propagation of particular events through multiple components.\n\n## Optimizations\n\n`react-hotkeys` uses a lot of optimizations to help keep it as performant as possible (both in terms of time and memory). It can be helpful to be aware of some of these measures if you are seeing unexpected behaviour:\n\n### Code optimizations\n\n- If an event is handled by an earlier handler, it is ignored by an further components (this is really a design decision, rather than an optimization, but it helps).\n- By default, `stopPropagation()` is called on all key events once `react-hotkeys` has handled them. This can be disabled via the `stopEventPropagationAfterHandling` and `stopEventPropagationAfterIgnoring` [configuration options](#Configuration).\n- Events are ignored unless an action exists that is bound to that particular event type (keydown, keypress, keyup)\n- Events are processed at each level, as they propagate up the React render tree. If a action is triggered by a leaf node, `react-hotkeys` stops there (and does not build the full application's mappings of key sequences and handlers)\n- Changes to keyMaps and handlers are ignored unless you explicitly opt-in to the behaviour of resetting them each time their prop value changes.\n- Key histories longer than the longest registered key sequence are discarded.\n- The mapping between an action's key sequences and handlers is built \"on-the-fly\", so unless a particular action is triggered, `react-hotkeys` doesn't do the work of finding its corresponding handler.\n- Global event listeners are only bound to `document` when a global hotkey is defined (and are removed when the last one is unmounted).\n\n### Production optimizations\n\n- The production build strips out all comments and logging statements below a level of warning, before undergoing minification using Uglify.\n- An es6 version is also available, that allows for tree-shaking in compatible build setups.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Chrisui/react-hotkeys) to ask any questions you may have regarding how to use `react-hotkeys`.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/issues).\n\n## Stability & Maintenance\n\n`react-hotkeys` is considered stable and already being widely used (most notably Lystable and Whatsapp).\n\n## Contribute, please!\n\nIf you're interested in helping out with the maintenance of `react-hotkeys`, make yourself known on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Chrisui/react-hotkeys), [open an issue](https://github.com/greena13/react-hotkeys/issues) or create a pull request.\n\nAll contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated -

A pull request with a breaking test would be super preferable here but isn't required\n\n### Submitting a Pull Request\n\n- Squash commits\n- Lint your code with eslint (config provided)\n- Include relevant test updates/additions\n\n## Build notes\n\n`react-hotkeys` uses a mixture of build tools to create each of the development and production bundles, which can be confusing to navigate and understand.\n\n### Build scripts\n\nAll build commands are included in the `package.json`:\n\n| Command                      | Description                                                                                |\n| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `yarn prepublish`            | Build all bundles using babel and rollup                                                   |\n| `yarn build-cjs`             | Build the development and production CommonJS bundles using babel and rollup, respectively |\n| `yarn build-es`              | Build the development and production ES6 bundles using babel and rollup, respectively      |\n| `yarn build-umd`             | Build the development and production UMD bundles using rollup                              |\n| `yarn build-development`     | Build the development CommonJS bundle using babel                                          |\n| `yarn build-es-development`  | Build the development ES6 bundle using babel                                               |\n| `yarn build-umd-development` | Build the development ES6 bundle using rollup                                              |\n| `yarn build-production`      | Build the production CommonJS bundle using rollup                                          |\n| `yarn build-es-production`   | Build the production ES6 bundle using rollup                                               |\n| `yarn build-umd-production`  | Build the production ES6 bundle using rollup                                               |\n\n### Development builds\n\n| Bundle   | Transpiled with | Modularized with | Output        |\n| :------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |\n| CommonJS | Babel           | Babel            | /cjs/index.js |\n| UMD      | Babel           | Rollup           | /umd/index.js |\n| ES6      | Babel           | Babel            | /es/index.js  |\n\n### Production builds\n\n| Bundle   | Transpiled with | Optimized with | Minified with | Output                              |\n| :------- | :-------------- | :------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------- |\n| CommonJS | Babel           | Rollup         | Uglify        | cjs/react-hotkeys.production.min.js |\n| UMD      | Babel           | Rollup         | Uglify        | /umd/react-hotkeys.min.js           |\n| ES6      | Babel           | Rollup         | Babel-minify  | /es/react-hotkeys.production.min.js |\n\n### Build configuration\n\nTo understand the configuration for any one build, you need to consult 3 places:\n\n- The CLI arguments used in the `scripts` of `package.json`\n- The `.babelrc` file (match the env to the `BABEL_ENV` value set in `scripts` above)\n- The `rollup.configs.js` (if applicable)\n\n## Authorship\n\nAll credit, and many thanks, goes to [Chris Pearce](https://github.com/Chrisui) for the inception of `react-hotkeys` and all versions before `1.0.0`.\n",
